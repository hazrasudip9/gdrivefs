To build a .deb, try running:

./package.sh <VERSION>

This installs a jar-with-dependencies in /usr/lib, and
a helper script in /usr/bin (called gdrivefs).

After installation, you can mount a gdrive with the following command:

sudo mount -t gdrive <email_address> <mountdir>

And you can unmount using this command:

sudo umount <mountdir_from_earlier>
