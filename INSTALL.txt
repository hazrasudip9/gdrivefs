To build a .deb, try running:

./package.sh <VERSION>

This installs a jar-with-dependencies in /usr/lib, and
a helper script in /usr/bin (called gdrivefs). Let me
know if this actually works for you. I had eclipse
generate the ant build to package the jar, and I
don't know how nicely it will play with other setups.
(Particularly, it needs to be regenerated whenever new
jars are added, though this should be an easy fix.)

Mount integration is a little wonky currently. To mount:

sudo mount -t gdrive DUMMY_DEVICE <mountdir>

Unfortunately, mount refuses to work unless its given a device.
I'm trying to find out how best to handle this;
it's possible that fusermount could help (but I'm not sure
about this; I think the JNA fuse impl may actually
delegate to fusermount. Getting things working with mount
is a huge hack in the first place)

Unmounting is a little nicer, since it is delegated to fuse.
Just do:

sudo umount <mountdir_from_earlier>

This actually ends up calling the destroy method in
GoogleDriveLinuxFs, which is nice. Unfortunately,
something bad happens and it throws an exception,
and I'm not sure why yet.
